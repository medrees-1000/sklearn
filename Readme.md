## 🔧 Setup & Installation

You need to create a virtual environment for the repo for the Python packages to be installed.

```bash
# Create the virtual environment
python3 -m venv env 

# Freeze the requirements
pip freeze > requirements.txt  

# Install the requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt  

# Start the virtual environment (for Windows PowerShell)
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1  
```
